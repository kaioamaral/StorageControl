StorageControl

Hello there, this is a simple app developed in ASP.NET MVC (using c#)

Requirements:
- Visual Studio;
- SQL Server;


To make it run in your machine:
- Run the database.sql script;
- Create a connection string in your (for safety) machine.config named "ComerceStorage" and configure it;
